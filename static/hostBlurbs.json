        "Bingothon has raised over $15,000 for Fred Hutch in the past 4 years, all going towards lifesaving research, treatments and patient care, as well as helping over 80,000 people receiving the COVID-19 vaccine at Fred Hutch in the last couple of years. Furthermore, this is helping Fred Hutch unlock how cancers and infectious diseases start and spread, harnessing the immune system to fight disease, and working to make treatment more equitable and accessible for more people. Can we make it to $17,000 raised in total for them?",
        "Curious to know the impact of your donation towards Fred Hutch? $5 supplies 100 test tubes used by researchers. $50 pays for two hours of a junior researcher's time to pursue a new cancer therapy. $250 enables researchers to see which genes are switched on in cancer. And, $10,000 buys a special freezer that can store tissue, DNA and other samples used to unlock the mysteries of disease. With $15,000 raised for Fred Hutch in the past 4 years, this is what your contributions have therefore brought!",
        "Fred Hutch is a cancer research center where world-renowned scientists and humanitarians work together to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV and many other diseases. With three Nobel laureates among their researchers, they are at the front of the battle against those illnesses.",
        "Fred Hutch have earned a global reputation for their track record of discoveries in cancer, infectious disease and basic research, including important advances in bone marrow transplantation, HIV/AIDS prevention, immunotherapy and COVID-19 vaccines.",
        "Fred Hutch researchers were one of the major pioneers in the development of the bone marrow transplant, one of the most important medical advances in cancer treatment that has saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients around the world. Their Nobel Prize-winning bone marrow transplants have boosted survival rates from nearly zero to 90 percent for certain types of leukemia. Any physician who has performed one was either trained there or trained by someone who trained there.",
        "Beyond their research, Fred Hutch has a Survivorship Program aimed to help ensure that patients, their families and their caregivers can live a high quality life even beyond treatment.",

        "Researchers from Fred Hutch have won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine three times: in 1990, 2001, and 2004. Dr. E. Donnal Thomas was awarded in 1990 for his work on the bone marrow and blood stem cell transplantation. Dr. Leland Hartwell was awarded in 2001 for discovering the universal mechanism that controls cell division in all eukaryotic, or nucleated, organisms. And finally, Dr. Linda Buck was awarded in 2004 for her work on odorant receptors and the organization of the olfactory system — the network responsible for our sense of smell."
